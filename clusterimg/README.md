# Clusterimg
---
Tool for clustering mixed images

TO-TRY

TO-ADD
- test code
- openmp
- C/C++/CUDA optimization
- Machine and Deep Learning

TO-TIDY
- move thread functions in another file
- move image reading functions to another file
- move global variables in another file
- functionalize multiple codes
- comment the whole code line by line
- try to remove images_folder_path complately
- variable names and full path list computations on outer functions
- clean the inside of process

TO-FIX
- fix interactive threshold selection
- merge get_image_dict and get_template_dict in one and merge get_corner_features, delete unnecessary variables/computations
- inside of select_threshold function
